“大家好，我是2010年从吉林大学毕业的。说起我的工作经历，那可真是充满了‘传奇色彩’。
我先是在阿里巴巴，那可是个‘大佬’云集的地方，每天都能感受到互联网行业的蓬勃朝气。然后，我去了中科海云，本来以为能在那里大展拳脚，结果公司却先我一步‘大展宏图’——倒闭了。哈哈，不过没关系，我可是打不倒的小强！
接着，我又加入了NNIT，想着这次一定要稳住。可谁知道，这家公司也步了中科海云的后尘，又倒闭了。我开始怀疑，我是不是有‘倒闭公司克星’的体质啊？
然后，我去了Accenture，心想这次一定要把握住机会。可是，命运总是那么出人意料，公司居然裁员了！我当时就想，这到底是怎么回事？我怎么就这么‘幸运’呢？
不过，幸运的是，我最终还是找到了我的‘归宿’——Citi。看来，我还是有魅力的，不然怎么能在这么多‘波折’之后，还能找到这么好的公司呢？哈哈，开个玩笑！其实，我觉得这些经历都让我更加珍惜现在的工作，也让我更加明白，无论遇到什么困难，都要坚持下去，因为总会有更好的机会在等着我们！”


"Hello everyone, I graduated from Jilin University in 2010. Speaking of my work experience, it's quite a 'legendary' journey.
I started at Alibaba, a place where 'big names' gather, and I could feel the vibrant atmosphere of the internet industry every day. Then, I joined Zhongke Haiyun, thinking I could make a big difference there. But guess what? The company went bankrupt before I could even get started. Haha, but no worries, I'm like a little strong plant that can't be easily knocked down!
Next, I joined NNIT, determined to stabilize my career this time. But who knew, this company also followed Zhongke Haiyun's footsteps and went bankrupt. I started to wonder if I had a 'curse' that makes companies go bankrupt.
After that, I went to Accenture, hoping to seize the opportunity this time. But fate always has its surprises, and the company ended up laying off employees! I thought, 'What's going on? Why am I so 'lucky'?
Fortunately, I eventually found my 'home' at Citi. I guess I still have charm, otherwise how could I have found such a great company after so many 'twists and turns'? Haha, just kidding! Actually, I think these experiences have made me cherish my current job more, and they've also taught me that no matter what difficulties we face, we should persevere because there will always be better opportunities waiting for us!"
